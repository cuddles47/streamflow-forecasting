The hydroelectric project Bản Chát is constructed in the Mường Kim commune, Than Uyên district, Lai Châu province. It is one of the two projects forming a cascade of hydroelectric plants along the Nậm Mu River. The reservoir's construction aims to serve agricultural needs, mitigate downstream floods, and generate electricity. With a designed capacity of 220MW, upon activation, the Bản Chát hydroelectric plant will annually supply 1,158.1x106 KWh of electricity to the national power grid.

With a reservoir capacity of 1,702 billion m3, the Bản Chát hydroelectric project plays a vital role in regulating water for the Đà River system and downstream of the Red River, contributing to flood control for downstream projects. Ensuring the safety of the dam structure and downstream areas during reservoir operation is a crucial prerequisite. Effective reservoir regulation requires understanding the inflow to the reservoir, calculated from rainfall and evaporation data in the watershed, making it a critical task.

Forecasting inflow is a prerequisite for reservoir operation, but it is a complex and uncertain task. Typically, hydrological models are used to calculate flow from rainfall, but current hydrological models do not fully simulate the physical processes of flow formation in the watershed or continuously update changes in land cover. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been rapidly developing and applied in various fields. Flow forecasting is a potential application for modern AI technology. AI models, with their ability to self-update during training, can fill the gaps existing in hydrological models.

For these reasons, research is being conducted to apply artificial intelligence in forecasting flow to the Bản Chát reservoir. In recent years, machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, has seen significant development and application in various fields. Flow forecasting is one of the promising areas for applying this modern technology. AI models, with their self-updating capability during training, can fill gaps in existing hydrological models. Therefore, research is underway to apply artificial intelligence in flow forecasting, as hydrological models are widely used in regulating rainfall and flow. The prediction of rainfall runoff is considered a representation of time series forecasting.

In machine learning, there are four methods for forecasting based on time series data: univariate regression models, simultaneous equation regression models, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Each class of time series forecasting models has unique characteristics and requires strict adherence to conditions such as stationarity, white noise, and autocorrelation. There are many different classes of time series models, and each class has specific application criteria.

The ARIMA model, relying on past values of the variable to be forecasted, is commonly used and proves more effective in short-term forecasting of time series data such as exchange rates, inflation, growth, temperature forecasting, and precipitation compared to other models.

Similarly, the VAR model stands out for its simplicity; there is no need to worry about determining which variables are endogenous and which are exogenous. All variables in VAR are endogenous; simple estimation, meaning ordinary least squares (OLS) method, can be applied to each equation separately; in many cases, forecasts obtained by this method are better than forecasts from more complex simultaneous equation models.

With rainfall in the watershed considered as the input for the reservoir, the ARIMA model by Box-Jenkins is likely the most effective with past water flow data as its primary input to explain its present state. An alternative method to the Box-Jenkins approach is the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Therefore, the research topic, "Using ARIMA and VAR models to forecast flow to the Bản Chát reservoir," has been chosen for further study.
