![Streamflow](link-to-your-image.png) <!-- Replace with an image related to streamflow or your project -->

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive streamflow forecasting project that employs two powerful time series forecasting techniques: **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** and **VAR (Vector Autoregression)**. Streamflow forecasting is critical for effective water resource management, and this project aims to provide accurate predictions using advanced statistical methods.

## Key Features 🌟

### ARIMA Modeling

- Implementation of ARIMA models to capture temporal patterns and autocorrelation in streamflow data.
- Fine-tuning model parameters for optimal forecasting performance.

### VAR Modeling

- Application of Vector Autoregression models to account for potential interdependencies among multiple time series variables affecting streamflow.
- Exploration of relationships and interactions among various hydrological factors for more nuanced predictions.

### Data Preparation and Exploration 🛠️🗺️

- Preprocessing of streamflow data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the quality of input data for the models.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of the streamflow time series.

### Evaluation and Validation 📊✅

- Rigorous evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting models.
- Cross-validation techniques to validate the models' generalization performance on diverse datasets.
